Calendar run interval for Prestashop

In the standard Prestashop engine, there is no functionality for choosing the date and time of delivery in the cart.

This functionality was implemented earlier. Now it was necessary to supplement the calendar functionality:

1) That it was impossible to select dates in the calendar when the company does not work.
2) Sunday - it was always inactive for selection.
3) It was necessary to urgently implement it so that it would be impossible to select dates in the calendar from 23.12.20 to 04.01.21.
